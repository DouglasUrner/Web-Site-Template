  <!--  The p tag marks paragraphs. -->
  <!--  The i and em tags are usually equivalent. The difference is that the em (emphasis) tag conveys the idea
        that the content is being emphasized, not just styled as italic. 
        There are corresponding b and strong tags as well. -->

  <!--  HTML has three ways to generate a list. The ol tag creates an ordered list (with numbers), the ul tag create an
        unordered list, with bullets. The li tag is used in both kinds of lists for the list items. -->

    <dt>HTML attributes</dt>
    <dd>The <b>attributes</b> of an HTML tag provide additional information necessary for the browser to correctly
    render the tag. For example, the <b>img</b> tag has a <b>src</b> attribute that is used to tell the browser where
    to find the image.</dd>
    
    <dt>HTML elements</dt>
    <dd>Are the basic components of a document described by the markup. This element is the definition section of
    a definition list â€“ it marked up with the <b>dd</b>tag.</dd>
