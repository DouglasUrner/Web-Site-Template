  <!--  HTML has three ways to generate a list. The ol tag creates an ordered list (with numbers), the ul tag create an
        unordered list, with bullets. The li tag is used in both kinds of lists for the list items. -->

    <dd>The <b>attributes</b> of an HTML tag provide additional information necessary for the browser to correctly
    render the tag. For example, the <b>img</b> tag has a <b>src</b> attribute that is used to tell the browser where
    to find the image.</dd>
