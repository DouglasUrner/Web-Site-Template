# Instructions

1. Fork this repository (make a copy of it for yourself).

1. If you have a working site on GitHub Pages from the tutorial, rename it (from the Settings menu) so that you can use the name for your new repository.

1. Rename the Web-Site-Template repository to the name of your GitHub Pages site:

  *your-github-name*.github.io

1. Check that the site is visible. Go to:

  http://your-github-name.github.io
